# Recipe Batao App

<<<<<<< HEAD
A Project Based Learning Flutter project.

### Getting Started
The app is developed using Flutter, Lit Firebase for Login and Signup, Firestore for Backend and Spoonacular API for fetching Recipes.

### Insights
The application will be able to provide the users with a variety of recipes according to their choice and preference. Currently the young generation struggles with simple cooking. Since they have to be independent due to studies / jobs at places away from family, they have to learn cooking. This app will help them learn the basic cooking and recipes as it will ask them what they want to eat and provide a detailed recipe and give a list of ingredients they will need to prepare for the recipe. They will be able to prepare recipes from basic to advanced levels according to their choice and availability of ingredients as well as equipment. It will help them to become independent and enjoy the process.

Along with the recipes, users will be able to keep a track of all the ingredients they forget to use as they expire. The app will notify the user a few days before the product is about to expire. This will save a lot of food and avoid food wastage. Users can also search for recipes to use the products that are going to expire. In this way the user also learns new recipes and food wastage is avoided.

### Features
